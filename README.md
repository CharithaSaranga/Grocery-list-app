Grocery Bud is a simple web application that allows users to create a list of grocery items. Users can add items to the list, edit existing items, and delete items as needed. The application provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing grocery lists.

## Features

- **Edit Items**: Users can edit the name of an existing grocery item by clicking the edit button next to the item. The item name will be updated with the new value.
- **Delete Items**: Users can remove a grocery item from the list by clicking the delete button next to the item. The item will be permanently deleted from the list.
